This repository contains the Jupyter Notebooks that recorded the research I did under Dr. Giorgio Quer. We mainly focused on PPG and ECG signal data extraction and alignment between ECG-derived RRIT signal and PPG-derived RRIT signal.
For exhaustive details we did in the research, see the notebook titled UCSD Mentor Program 2016.ipynb.
